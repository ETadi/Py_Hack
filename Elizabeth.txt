The Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) is a measure used in heart rate variability analysis. To calculate RMSSD for a 30-minute interval based on mean interbeat interval per minute (IBI), you can follow these steps:

Obtain the mean interbeat interval per minute for the 30-minute interval.
Calculate the differences between successive IBIs.
Square these differences and compute their mean.
Take the square root of the result to get RMSSD.
Add this RMSSD value to the mean interbeat i

Calculate differences between successive IBIs
differences = [interbeat_intervals[i + 1] - interbeat_intervals[i] for i in range(len(interbeat_intervals) - 1)]

# Calculate differences between successive IBIs
differences = np.diff(mean_IBI_per_minute)
# Calculate the mean interbeat interval per minute
mean_IBI_per_minute = sum(interbeat_intervals_minutes) / len(interbeat_intervals_minutes)

# Square the differences
squared_differences = [diff ** 2 for diff in differences]

# Calculate the mean of squared differences
mean_squared_difference = np.mean(squared_differences)

# Calculate RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)
RMSSD = np.sqrt(mean_squared_difference)


# Add RMSSD to the mean interbeat interval
mean_IBI_with_RMSSD = mean_IBI_per_minute + RMSSD

data = np.array([100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109])
rmssd_value = rmssd(data)
print(rmssd_value)
diff = np.diff(data)
  return np.sqrt(np.mean(diff**2))
